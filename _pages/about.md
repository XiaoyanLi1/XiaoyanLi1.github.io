I am an Assistant Professor at Beijing University of Technology ([BJUT faculty page](https://sist.bjut.edu.cn/info/1403/2470.htm)). My current research passion is Embodied AI, with a particular focus on whole-body control for humanoid robots and Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models.

My academic journey includes a Postdoc at BJUT (collaborating with Prof. Baocai Yin), a Ph.D. from the Institute of Computing Technology, CAS (advised by Prof. Shiguang Shan), and a Master's degree from Brown University (advised by Prof. Benjamin Kimia).

Over the years, I have been deeply involved in computer vision and robotics research. I have consistently published first-author papers in top-tier venues, including CCF-A and CCF-B conferences, such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, IJCAI, and ICRA, and CAS Q1 journals, such as IEEE TPAMI and IEEE TNNLS.

I am always looking for self-motivated students to work on Embodied AI and Robotics.

**Openings:**

- **Master Students**: 2-3 openings per year.
- **Undergraduate Interns**: Long-term recruitment.
