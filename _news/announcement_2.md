### :star2: Our Philosophy

We believe that research is not merely a task to complete for a degree, but **an immersive and fascinating journey of discovery**.

We strive to build a team where everyone is excited about what they are doing—not just because they "have to," but because they "want to." If you are eager to build robots that can see, think, and act, and if you enjoy the thrill of solving hard problems, you have found the right place.

### :dart: Who We Are Looking For

**We do not use GPA as the sole filter.** A transcript tells us how well you take exams, but **code tells us how well you build the future.**

Here is what we value the most:

- **Passion is Priority #1.** You must be genuinely interested in **Embodied AI, Robotics, or Computer Vision**. We want students who are curious enough to read papers for fun and persistent enough to debug a model.

- **Hands-on Capability > Exam Scores.** We value "builders." You should be comfortable getting your hands dirty with code and systems. We prefer students who have deployed models on real robots or participated in coding competitions (ACM/ICPC, Kaggle) over those with perfect grades but zero practical experience.

- **Sharp Execution ("Get Things Done").** We value efficiency and professionalism. In our lab, being "capable" means you can take ownership of a problem, break it down, and execute the solution without needing hand-holding at every step.

- **Logical & Critical Thinking.** Research is about asking the right questions. We appreciate students who can think logically, challenge existing assumptions, and propose reasonable hypotheses.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Technical Prerequisites

While we welcome students from diverse backgrounds, the following skills will help you survive and thrive in our group:

- **Programming**: Proficient in **Python** (C++ is a strong plus). Familiarity with Linux environments.
- **Deep Learning**: Experience with **PyTorch** or TensorFlow. You should know how to train a network from scratch.
- **Mathematics**: Solid intuition in Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus.
- **English**: Ability to read and summarize CVPR/ICCV/ECCV papers efficiently.

---

### :rocket: What You Will Get

- **Top-tier Research Guidance**: Direct mentorship on cutting-edge topics.
- **Publication Opportunities**: Support to publish in top venues (CVPR, ICRA, TPAMI, etc.).
- **Computing Resources**: Access to ample GPU resources and robot platforms.
- **A Fun Atmosphere**: A collaborative environment where ideas are respected.
